# Gridfinity Silabs board supports

Welcome to the Silabs board supports based on Gridfinity Extended OpenSCAD project!

This is using Chris Heazlewoodd port of Zack Freedman's Gridfinity system in OpenSCAD, designed to accurately reproduce the original Gridfinity bins while adding extra features and customization options.

## Features

- Accurate reproduction of Zack Freedman's original Gridfinity bins.
- Additional features and customization options for the base model.
- Extension patterns for further personalization and modularity.
- Silabs WSTK, DK and EK supports

## Getting Started

**Gridfinity Extended** is a set of OpenSCAD scripts for generating gridfinity related 3d models. 

### Running locally

Running locally is how I recommend running the scripts. The scripts run faster and you can save your configuration. However but it does require you download and install the OpenSCAD software on your local machine.

1. Install OpenSCAD. This project relies on features available in the **OpenSCAD Developer Version**. Make sure to download it from [OpenSCAD Developer Version](https://openscad.org/downloads.html#snapshots).
2. Clone or download this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Jerome-Silabs/gridfinity-silabs.git
   ```

   Alternatively, you can download the ZIP file from the repository page and extract it.
3. Open the project files in OpenSCAD. **Note:** You must use the developer version of OpenSCAD for this project. Download it here: [OpenSCAD Developer Version](https://openscad.org/downloads.html#snapshots).
4. Start exploring and customising the Gridfinity EVB board supports!

## Documentation

Official detailed documentation for each of the scripts can be found here [gridfinity-extended](https://docs.ostat.com/docs/openscad/gridfinity-extended)

Official Openscad documentation can be found here [Openscad](https://openscad.org/documentation.html)
